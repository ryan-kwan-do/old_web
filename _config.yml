  - paragraph:
    I also help organizations understand their performance and how to improve it. I have experience working with
    ?link? and ?link?, helping to simplify big data and communicate it to make better decisions.
    For more on my professional side see my ?link? page.

 - paragraph: These are the research projects I have underway&#58;
    1. Organizing for well-being within PhD programs - This is the evolution of the Asociació d'investigadors en formació,
    a project that tragically failed but whose spirit lives on. An interdisciplinary project which
    addresses the mental health crisis in PhD programs.

    2. Learning or Failing? Towards finding a balance - Organizations need to succeed, but failing is a great way to learn.
    This project explores the question - How can organizations find the right balance, and what happens if they don't?

    3. Resolving retroductive, abductive, inductive, and deductive approaches to knowledge building in management - These logics
    are often presented as conflicting. This paper aims to argue that when they work together knowledge building flourishes. A
    semi-critical realist take.

    4. A stratified view of performance management - This project is a ?link? of the theory that explains performance measurement
    and management and outlines its many levels

  - paragraph: On the side I'm into playing around with the ?link?, exploring the Catalonian
               countryside on foot or on bike, sustainable gardening, worm farms, eco-construction,
               reading philosophy, and trying to walk on my hands. I enjoy communicating in a general sense and welcome frequent interaction with humans and other mammals.
               Do feel free to contact me if you are interested in collaborating.
