 I work with organizations to learn about complex problems and what can be done at them. My research interests lie in the challenges relating to the 4th Industrial revolution---technological change, big data, the possibility of attack by robots---and how to navigate them through systems thinking. For humans, all of this change generates quite a bit of uncertainty that can be difficult to deal with.

 I finished my Ph.D. in Business at the University of Barcelona in December 2018. Nowadays I spend a good amount of my time writing about the philosophy of organizing and management and what all this means for knowledge creation and practice, especially strategy and performance management. A description of my research activity is on [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ryan_Armstrong4) and [here](/research.html), on this very website!

### Current Projects

I also help organizations understand their performance and how to improve it. I have experience working with
[HireMojo](https://hiremojo.com) and [Accolo Business Services](https://accolo.com) helping to simplify big data and communicate it to make better decisions. I am also Treasurer at [Science Dating Forum](http://scientistsdatingforum.org/), a group working for increased dissemination of research findings.
