 I work with organizations to learn about complex problems and what can be done at them. My research interests lie in the challenges relating to the 4th Industrial revolution---technological change, big data, the possibility of attack by robots---and how to navigate them through systems thinking. For humans, all of this change generates quite a bit of uncertainty that can be difficult to deal with.

 I am currently in the final stages of my PhD at the University of Barcelona, where I spend a good amount of my time writing about the philosophy of organizing and management and what all this means for knowledge creation and practice, especially strategy and performance management. A description of my research activity is on [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ryan_Armstrong4).

### Current Projects

I also help organizations understand their performance and how to improve it. I have experience working with
[HireMojo](https://hiremojo.com) and [Accolo Business Services](https://accolo.com) helping to simplify big data and communicate it to make better decisions. I am also Treasurer at [Science Dating Forum](http://scientistsdatingforum.org/), a group working for increased dissemination of research findings.

#### These are the research projects I have underway:

1. Organizing for well-being within PhD programs---This is the evolution of the [Asociació d'investigadors en formació](http://www.aief.cat/),
    a project about creating a strong community of organizational PhD researchers that tragically failed but whose spirit lives on. Its continuation is an interdisciplinary project which addresses the mental health crisis in PhD programs.
1. Learning or Failing? Towards finding a balance - Organizations need to succeed, but failing is a great way to learn.
    This project explores the question - How can organizations find the right balance, and what happens if they don't?
1. Resolving retroductive, abductive, inductive, and deductive approaches to knowledge building in management - These logics
    are often presented as conflicting. This paper aims to argue that when they work together knowledge building flourishes. A
    semi-critical realist take.
1. A stratified view of performance management - This project is a [realist synthesis](https://www.betterevaluation.org/en/evaluation-options/realistsynthesis) of the theory that explains performance measurement and management and outlines its many levels"

On the side I'm into exploring the Catalonian countryside on foot or on bike, sustainable gardening, worm farms, eco-construction, reading philosophy, and trying to walk on my hands. I enjoy communicating in a general sense and welcome frequent interaction with humans and other mammals. Do feel free to contact me if you are interested in collaborating.
