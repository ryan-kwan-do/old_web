Struggling with complexity? Is your change initiative meeting resistance? Do you constantly face the same challenges over and over?

I work with organizations to face the challenges that come along with operating in a complex, changing world. Below are some of the services I offer. If you're interested in working with me, I encourage you to [reach out](/contact.html)!

## Change Management

Change is the only constant, so they say, but unfortunately resisting it comes rather naturally to most of us.
With the rate of social and technological change increasing year over year, sustainable teams will be those who can change most effectively.
How can you do that?
I work with organizations and teams large and small to address this complex challenge using inclusive, participatory techniques.  

## Co-Visioning

The most sustainable and most powerful strategies are those that draw on the collective intelligence of the entire organization. But gathering that information is not easy. I can help change leaders listen.

## Systems Thinking Workshops

Scientists are increasingly in agreement that everything is connected.
Systems thinking workshops are useful for combating things.
They can be used in conflict management, or when a diverse group of stakeholders need to work together on a project.

## Visual Facilitation

Need to organize a team meeting?

## Training

I offer customized training on areas of project management, organizational learning, supervisor management, and positive practice.
