A weekend at home with Andrew Collier and Critical Realism
==========================

Girlfriend is out
------

Time to get critically real. The cats are curled up, I have cleaned the apartment, and a persistent cold prevents me from enjoying the Barcelona spring. And so here I am, bundled up on couch, preparing to enter the second half of Andrew Collier's synthesis of the works of Roy Bhaskar. 

The first half
--------------
I found Roy by way of a Ray---[Ray Pawson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Pawson), that is---who works on explaining interventions as they work in complex social settings. I had more *ah-ha!* moments in the days it took me to finish his (2006) book than my entire first year of predoctoral study. Finally, someone with a way through the dark swamps of social science!

Little did I know that Pawson's text would lead me to study more philosophy of science than I ever had a mind to; much, much, much more, in fact. I suppose a would-be research exclaiming "Nobody knew the truth could be so complicated!" would be bit too similar to [recent proclamations](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/feb/27/trump-healthcare-complicated-budget-video), so I exclaimed mainly in my head, but the initial foray into (critical) realism turned a longer excursion, and eventually, my first two papers would center around it.

Nearly years after my first encounter with Ray Pawson (actually, his ideas were the foundation of my [favorite article](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0170840607088020) in management as an MasterÂ´s student, I just didn't know it!) I have applied the ideas in the field, read the [Journal of Critical Realism](http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/yjcr20), and have two papers in review that feature it front and center. Still, I am just a philosophy of science user---if only they had told me that it was possible to use the stuff in Western Civilization I might have paid more attention!

The first half is enough. I got there with Pawson, [Andwer Sayer](https://www.amazon.com/Method-Social-Science-Revised-2nd/dp/0415076072), [Bhaskar's *A Realist Theory of Science*](https://www.amazon.com/Realist-Theory-Science-Radical-Thinkers/dp/1844672042/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8), and a handful of articles (albeit a big handful). Put that on top of methodological training at the doctoral level and I'm able to produce something that might be explanation building and drone on about how cool it is enough that I have become the *pesado* critical realist of my little bunch of PhD students.

The second half
---------------
What I have would be enough, I suppose, but I have to wonder, "What else did Bhaskar say?" I heard his later works were tough to read. His youtube videos are fun, but my girlfriend complained once that he says "Um" too much, and now that is about all I hear. Enter Collier.

A [book](https://www.amazon.es/Critical-Realism-Introduction-Bhaskars-Philosophy/dp/0860916022) about Roy Bhaskar's philosophy for the rest of us. Armed with ideas about the real, the actual, and the empirical, and mechanisms, and emergence, I go forth now with enough enthusiasm to spend an hour writing a blog post about getting read to read the second half of a book instead of actually reading it. This is what happens when the house is empty.
