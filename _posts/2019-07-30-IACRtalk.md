Delighted to have been accepted to give my talk "Revisiting RRREIC for interdisciplinary research: exploring challenges and opportunities in a well-being project" at the International Association for Critical Realism (IACR) at the University of Southhampton.

RRREIC, for resolution, redescription, retroduction (or retrodiction), elimination, identification, and correction, is meant to be an alternative to how the scientific process of discovery is seen. It was introduced by Roy Bhaskar in 1986 as an alternative to the nomothetic or hypothetico-deductive model.

I have found RRREIC to be an accessible framework to get scientists of different background communicating with each other.
The difference over the hypothesis-focused style of the post-positivist models is that there is more room for "sense-making" in that it deals with the movement from observation to formulating hypotheses in a way I find much more complete (actually, RRREIC doesn't include formulating hypotheses, but <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318995141_Why_things_happen_-_Developing_the_critical_realist_view_of_causal_mechanisms">that's another story</a>.) The image below, from <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321326336_The_Weak_Spots_in_Contemporary_Science_and_How_to_Fix_Them">this article</a>, is a typical interpretation of the hypothetico-deductive approach:

Further, it's exciting for management and organizational studies especially because it parallels the "opening" and "closing" phases of effective problem structuring exercises. So talking about RRREIC and resolving (or trying to resolve) its issues is a way for researchers and practitioners to make these actions more deliberate and more effective.

Hope to see you at my talk!
