Networking is [important](https://hbr.org/2007/01/how-leaders-create-and-use-networks) for just about every aspect of organizational life. But for many, especially those just starting out, it can be uncomfortable. This post describes a fun ice-breaking activity that can be used for strangers and colleagues alike.

Some background: Recently I helped host a speed networking event for a group of people interested in Open Science. As the name implies, Open Science attracts all shapes and sizes, but especially lab scientists. A Speed Dating set-up seemed right from the beginning, but without the incentive that comes from looking for romance or... whatever, could speed dating for networking have the same thrill?  

Would the event be a bust?

Not wanting to risk it, we sought help from Crayons.

Below is a description of the activity developed for the event.

## Speed Networking with Mind Maps

Our activity using a speed dating set-up: We'll be taking 3-to-5-minute rounds to learn a little about a lot of people very quickly.
Mind mapping is a means of augmenting the speed dating concept to make it more fun for networking.

This is what a mind map looks like:

### Materials you need:
* Crayons  or dark colored pencils (pens are OK but don't allow for mistakes!)
* Erasers
* A3-sized paper. A4 can be OK in a pinch
* Tables and chairs for participants, arranged in a U
* A hard surface to draw on
* Stickers of different colors (I like Yellow and Green, since both are neutral. Avoid Red.)
* Prizes


### Preparation:

1. Create 4 or 5 guiding questions (examples below)
1. Find a suitable space with plenty of room and good ambiance. We chose a brew hall.
1. Make sure there the space has a hard surface to draw on


### Steps:

1. Write your name in the middle of the paper
1. Write the 4 to 5 guiding themes (see example)
1. Everyone has 7 minutes to complete their mind map.
1. Now, participants go through rounds of 3 minutes comparing their maps. With a partner,
1. After each round, the facilitators give those with the most concepts in common a victory sticker to put on their map (one sticker for each person). Those with the least in common get a yellow sticker. "In common" means related. When in doubt, let the partners decide. In case of a tie, the people of both groups get a point.
1. Continue until everyone has had a turn together or however many rounds you want (more than 10 is a drag)
1. At the end, the winners are those with the most green stickers (Mr. Ms. Congeniality) or the most yellow stickers (Mr. Ms. Unicorn)

## Example:

This is an example to get you started. This was for a networking event with people interested in Open Science, and the themes are presented accordingly.

### Preparation

#### Guiding questions:

* How do you use science in your daily life?
* Whatâ€™s something you wish you knew more about?
* What special (science) skills do you have?
* What appeals to you about Open Science?
* What goals do you have?

#### Choosing a location:

We chose a brew hall with lots of room so we could arrange tables in a 'U'.

#### The main event

Participants had about 7 minutes to draw their maps.

Here is what mine looked like:

Next, participants pair off with a partner and compare maps for three-minute rounds. They keep track of things they have in common, where "in common" has a broad interpretation. For example, "getting better at grant writing", one of the things I wish I knew more about, could be in common with "knowing a lot about grant writing". When in doubt, let the teams decide what is and is not "in common". The important thing is to have fun!

Beverages can help, but not required.
