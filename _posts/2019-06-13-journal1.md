Thoughts:

So yesterday I'm bitching about a rejection from Warwick and today I get two emails, one inviting me as a 'keynote speaker' (quotes because my first thought is "are you frigging for real" and doubting that they are friggin for real) and the other one inviting me to be co-author on a paper that appears to be for some type of predatory editorial service (where their realness or lack thereof is not in question).

Conclusion: Chin up. Embrace rejection. Love learning. Epoch√© for the betterment of being and life.
