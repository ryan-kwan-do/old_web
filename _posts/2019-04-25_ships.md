## Quote of the day:
"Scientists are like sailors who must repair a rotting ship at sea. They trust the great bulk of timbers while they replace a particularly weak plank. Each of the timbers they now trust they may, in its turn, replace." (Shadish, Cook and Campbell, 2002)

Also, the ship was built within an oppressive and exploitative quasi-capitalist system which will attempt to cut the scientists' funding on arrival and deny access to future rotting ships unless they can convince everyone of the plank's immediate practical impact.
